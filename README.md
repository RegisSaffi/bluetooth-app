## How to run this project

This project is built with Flutter and Dart language, It is created with Flutter `1.26` version, and Dart `2.12.0` version.

I took above screenshots from Android emulator and iOS simulator (which doesn't support bluetooth) but i also run it on both Android and iOS real devices and it works as expected, I can provide APK or IPA if needed.
